  interactive projection, videos, thoughts and drawings\

  during the three weeks I got to focus on my relationship to the ocean, especially the mediterrean, past works, memories, different perspectives as well as research connecting to geopolitical issues, migration and ecological crisis. the result of the residency is an archive of photographs, videos, thoughts and illustrations that can be explored through drawing. the pompous rooms of the former hotel became the stage for this ocean view.\
