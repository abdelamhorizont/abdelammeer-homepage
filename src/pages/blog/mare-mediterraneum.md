Description: >-
      The Mediterranean Sea as a border, as a place, as a space - for wind,
  waves and ground, for journeys, for escape, for sea dwellers, cargo ships and
  narratives, for longing, for memories, for stagnation, for movement and
  currents.


      


      in this seminar we will take time to reflect, to remember, to read and write, draw and film, experiment on analogue and digital moving image — on a personal level then abstract and connect to global issues, deal with the possibilities to pinpoint a topic for individual or a collective work as well as a presentation method through projections on different materials with the aim to visualize in time and space. 


      


      We will read texts from ‚Undrowned‘, Black Feminist Lessons from Marine Mammals by Alexis Pauline Gumbs, listen to ‚Saying Water‘, a monologue by Roni Horn, follow investigations of Forensic Architecture and Migrant Journal, browse through geographic maps, charts and data sources. — and then we will go to the beach. I mean, we have to. We will go to southern france for a workshop and visit the Rencontres d’Arles. More on that later this afternoon.
