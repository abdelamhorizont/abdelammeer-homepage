      in this seminar we took time to reflect, to remember, to read and write,
      draw and film, experiment on analogue and digital moving image — on a
      personal level then abstracted and connected to global issues, dealt with
      the possibilities to pinpoint a topic for individual or a collective work
      as well as a presentation method through projections on different
      materials with the aim to visualize in time and space. 


      We read texts from ‚Undrowned‘, Black Feminist Lessons from Marine Mammals by Alexis Pauline Gumbs, listened to ‚Saying Water‘, a monologue by Roni Horn, followed investigations of Forensic Architecture and Migrant Journal, browsed through geographic maps, charts and data sources. — and then we went to the beach. I mean, we had to. We travelled to southern france work in Marseille and to visit Les Rencontres d’Arles.

      do you do? If you see someone like you, a mammal, but unlike you—not bound
      by boats and masks and land—you might wonder who they are, what they are
      doing, how do they do it. How do they live in salt and depth and motion?
      You very well might wonder.“* — Black Feminist Lessons from Marine Mammals

Description: The Mediterranean Sea as a border, as a place, as a space - for
  wind, waves and ground, for journeys, for escape, for sea dwellers, cargo
  ships and narratives, for longing, for memories, for stagnation, for movement
  and currents.
