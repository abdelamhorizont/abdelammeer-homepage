Description: >-
  This installation is an interactive exploration of what kind of an appearance
  an artificial intelligence might choose, what questions it might ask and
  therefore what identity it could have. This chatbot is a counter design to the
  common commercial assistants that exist on the market. The dialogues shown in
  the excerpts are only a few of many possible ones that can be experienced
  interactively through conversation.\

  \

  The chatbot will change the appearance depending on the flow of the conversation to anything unorganic, living or immortal just to find it's true form. The form triggers different perspectives from nature to compare the evolutionary, biological and mortal with the digital.\

  \

  Questions that the bot asks are randomly generated. Not only linguistic elements are thrown together, but also visual ones. For this purpose, a tool was programmed that can be used to illustrate, animate and tag the result with terms that evoke them. Thus, depending on the content of the conversation, different compositions result.
