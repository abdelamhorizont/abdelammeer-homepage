Description: What and who and how and why? So many questions around AI, tools,
  models and training Data, possibilities, limitations and risks. Using these
  technologies to comment on the very same ones through the lenses of history,
  politics, society, culture and science we approached this with humour as a
  high order maybe-intelligence.

      The seminar (Non) Artificial (Maybe) Intelligence was my first one working
      as an academic associate at the Karlsruhe University of Arts and Design in
      the winter semester 2022, a time where generative AI was reaching new
      levels and public popularity was high through Image generation platforms
      like Midjourney, OpenAi or Stable Diffusion. Actually ChatGPT was released
      midway during the seminar. Not knowing the school and the students I chose
      this topic for a seminar anticipating some interest and to expand on the
      research I had started during my graduation work [deep sea
      bot](http://localhost:8000/space/deep-sea-bots/). where I imagined what
      form and body a digital assistance might take and hence what agency and
      motivation it could have.


      Starting with the ‚demystification‘ of the words *Artificial* and *Intelligence* we tried to get an understanding of the architecture of data models, especially regarding equity of training data, classification bias and unseen labour, through reading, testing, using and misusing these tools. Our goals were the following:


      * **Define contextualization methods**

      * **understand machine learning and evaluate social relevance**

      * **Try out and analyze A.I. natural language processing and language to code, tools like Dall-E, monster mesh (3D), EbSynth (rotoscope animation), and and and**

      * **Comment on these tools through practical use or misuse of the same tools**

      * **document and reflect on what we learned**


      We started by playing AI Dungeon, a text-based, AI generated fantasy simulation game, then we read The Nooscope Manifested by Vladan Joler and Matteo Pasquinelli, Excavating AI - The Politics of Images in Machine Learning Training Sets by Kate Crawford and Trevor Paglen, watched computational and mathematical explanations by Daniel Shiffman and 3Blue1Brown, used COCO, Common Objects in Context Data Model, created our own Image Classification Models with Teachable Machine and ml5.js, played Google’s Quickdraw Pictionary game and, obviously, generated Images and type with midjourney, Dall-E and stable diffusion.


      Alongside the seminar, the participating students developed their own point of interest and created various works which we presented at the Future of Gestaltung Symposium at the HfG Karlsruhe in the format of a talk show named *AI, You & I*.




      T﻿he seminar took place every two weeks, seven days in total:


      **Day 1 Prologue** AI Dungeon Adventures and definition of contextualization methods


      **Day 2 Demystification** Uncovering Datasets and mathematical explanation of Neural Networks. Google Quickdraw, Teachable Machine, COCO Dataset.


      **Day 3 Models** Training own models, implementation and testing with ml5.js, Image Generation with Midjourney, Model and Data Provenance


      **Day 4 Hacking:** Stable Diffusion Inpainting, Typography


      **Day 5 Research:** Project Outlines


      **Day 6 Work:** Feedback


      **Day 7** Presentations
