Description: during the three weeks of this residency I focused on my
  relationship to the ocean, especially the mediterrean, past works, memories,
  different perspectives as well as research connecting to geopolitical issues,
  migration and ecological crisis. the result of the residency is an archive of
  photographs, videos, thoughts and illustrations that can be explored through
  drawing. the pompous rooms of the former hotel became the stage for this ocean
  view.
