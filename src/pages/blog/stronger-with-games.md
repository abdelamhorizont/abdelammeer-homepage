      it‘s basically an engine where you can draw and animate characters,
      backgrounds and assets in pixel art and work collaboratively on a

    title: Minecraft
    text: M﻿inecraft, or the open source alternative Minetest, have been a great
      experience, especially during Covid lockdowns, a game with so many
      possibilities allowed for several interesting workshops on the topics of
      worldbuilding, architecture and speculation.
