Description: >-
  “what binds the universe together at its core?”, Faust asks. “what binds
  Typography together at its core?”, you ask back. — how do you kern a word ?
  how do you collect clouds? use a grid? chase rainbows? justify text? sort
  through rain? use punctuation marks? listen to dust? build information
  hierarchies? wait for sand? format footnotes? turn to air? — we will work on
  publications as instruction manuals for natural phenomena, in order to explore
  micro- and macrotypography, research and performance.
