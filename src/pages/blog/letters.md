Description: Writing letters, drawing letters, to you, to me, to strangers. To
  sharpen our senses, to think with our hands and touch with our minds, we will
  travel to pasts and futures, get in touch with ourselves, with ancestors and
  future generations, reconcile with butterflies and rivers and stars, dissect
  and rebuild the grids, structures and shapes of nature and society, come back
  and draw letters again.

    text: in this seminar we learned all about the history and developments of
      typography, built a vocabulary to speak about letters, typefaces and text;
      the details, differences and classifications, about arranging letters to
      words and words to text; readability, emotion, communication. text as
      image, semiotics, vernacular typography and appropriation, the labour,
      ressources and ecology related to typography. We did this very hand-on,
      with an emphasis on critical discussions, extensive experimentation and
      funnnnn.

      ! Ceramics model making Workshop


      Close your eyes, You are in a different place in a different time. In fact you don’t know what year it is, the concept of periodic time tracking has not been invented yet. Nor has been actually anything else. You find yourself standing on soft ground, the soil slightly wet from rain, some smaller and some bigger stones scattered around, accompanied be bushes and trees here and there, but no sight of houses or people, just distant sounds of some yet unknown creatures. Many years later this era will be known as the stone age.


      Without much thinking you kneel down to pick a handful of the soil, press it together between your hands to give it structure and slowly realize that you just time traveled from a seemingly advanced civilization that is still struggling with basic crises to a time where language has not yet developed. what information will you leave behind for the humans to come, and how? what are the signs and symbols that one will understand without the luxury of alphabets?


      you have 45 minutes until a hungry T-Rex will find and eat you.


      → extra task: invent your first word
