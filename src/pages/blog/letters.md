Description: Writing letters, drawing letters, to you, to me, to strangers. To
  sharpen our senses, to think with our hands and touch with our minds, we will
  travel to pasts and futures, get in touch with ourselves, with ancestors and
  future generations, reconcile with butterflies and rivers and stars, dissect
  and rebuild the grids, structures and shapes of nature and society, come back
  and draw letters again.
