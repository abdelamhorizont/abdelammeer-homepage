Description: Writing letters, drawing letters, to you, to me, to strangers. To
  sharpen our senses, to think with our hands and touch with our minds, we will
  travel to pasts and futures, get in touch with ourselves, with ancestors and
  future generations, reconcile with butterflies and rivers and stars, dissect
  and rebuild the grids, structures and shapes of nature and society, come back
  and draw letters again.

    text: in this seminar we learned all about the history and developments of
      typography, built a vocabulary to speak about letters, typefaces and text;
      the details, differences and classifications, about arranging letters to
      words and words to text; readability, emotion, communication. text as
      image, semiotics, vernacular typography and appropriation, the labour,
      ressources and ecology related to typography. We did this very hand-on,
      with an emphasis on critical discussions, extensive experimentation and
      fun.

      Unfortunately I got sick on the very first seminar day, so I made a virtue
      out of necessity and asked the class to write me get well letters. So nice
      to not find bills in your mail box!


      *! Task: Take the day to work on 1 Letter each und send it to me per post by the end of the day. Write me an encouraging message and think about how you write it! embrace the quirks and specialities in your handwriting and show off your signature! Pay attention to the pen you use, the paper and the envelope! You can also add other elements to the letter.*

      The letters led me to thinking about handwriting, especially the signature
      as a highly individualized token, where not only is a drawing performed
      using the hand and wrist that leads to more or less illegible flowing
      curves and angles — defined by fast motion and pressure to get things done
      — but also by family history, repetition, and the social construct to
      trust this drawing.




      1. write your signature big scale

      2. Deconstruction: make copies and cut out each letter

      3. Variation: arrange the letters differently to make anagrams

      4. Derivation: derive the whole alphabet from the letters of your signature

      5. letters to yourself write a letter to yourself on A1 with the letters you have

      For this seminar day please bring with you at least one:


      * TOOL such as, a Brush, Ketschup, Crayon, Hammer, Pencil, Broom, Eraser, Scissors, Fork, Marker, Spray, Toothbrush, Printer, Drill, Vegetable,...

      * MEDIUM such as, Ink, Sand, Paint, Water, Paper, Light, Foil, Pixel, Thread,...

      * OBJECT such as, Paper, Planet, Box, Hand, Book, Tennisball, Bottle, Tree,...




      *! Task: Everyone will start creating the letter forms of the latin alphabet. You have 20 minutes to draw 6 Letters, 3 lowercase, then 3 Uppercase. Move to the next station and proceed with the next 6 Letters*




      **instructions**


      1. what does the Tool want?

      2. Your “weak” arm is the Tool

      3. reverse flow

      4. introduce a rule

      5. combine Tools

      6. what does the Material want?

      7. Letters touch an Object

      8. introduce your letters to the space around you

      9. use another person as a tool

      10. use the scanner as a Tool

      11. introduce Nature to Typography

      12. each Letter different Tool

      13. Geometry




      The class and me were actually quite surprised and impressed by the results of this intense hands on day. Every student went through each instruction creating 13 alphabets in upper and lower case. 13 x 26 x 2 = approx. 600 Letters, 600 A4 Pages!

      What are conditions for readability? We read parts from The politics of
      design by Ruben Pater and discussed what makes readability including:
      literacy, ability, language, culture, person, inclusivity


      **Gestalt Principles**


      * Figure-ground

      * Proximity

      * Similarity

      * Continuity

      * Closure

      * Symmetry

      * Uniform connectedness

      * Parallelism

      * Common fate

      * Focal points

      * Past experience

      * Reification

      Grid walk, reading “Gloassary of Undisciplned Design” we walked around the
      school and looked for grids in the architecture. The students handed me
      the book at the part where I had to quote Britney Spears.


      *! choose words that describe your work values, whats important to you?*


      *! draw a grid based on the arcitecture of the school*


      *! exchange the grid with some one, draw the letters of your values into the grid*


      *! have the word interact with the space threedimonsionally*

      This day the students prepared presentations on popular typefaces using
      specific vocabulary to describe the letterforms (from Anatomie der
      Buchstaben) as well as historic context. Afterwards we went to the
      Kaiserstraße in Karlsruhe to look for these typefaces in their natural
      habitat.

      > Close your eyes, You are in a different place in a different time. In
      fact you don’t know what year it is, the concept of periodic time tracking
      has not been invented yet. Nor has been actually anything else. You find
      yourself standing on soft ground, the soil slightly wet from rain, some
      smaller and some bigger stones scattered around, accompanied be bushes and
      trees here and there, but no sight of houses or people, just distant
      sounds of some yet unknown creatures. Many years later this era will be
      known as the stone age.

      >

      > Without much thinking you kneel down to pick a handful of the soil, press it together between your hands to give it structure and slowly realize that you just time traveled from a seemingly advanced civilization that is still struggling with basic crises to a time where language has not yet developed. what information will you leave behind for the humans to come, and how? what are the signs and symbols that one will understand without the luxury of alphabets?

      >

      > you have 45 minutes until a hungry T-Rex will find and eat you.
