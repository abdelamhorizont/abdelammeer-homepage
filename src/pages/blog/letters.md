Description: Writing letters, drawing letters, to you, to me, to strangers. To
  sharpen our senses, to think with our hands and touch with our minds, we will
  travel to pasts and futures, get in touch with ourselves, with ancestors and
  future generations, reconcile with butterflies and rivers and stars, dissect
  and rebuild the grids, structures and shapes of nature and society, come back
  and draw letters again.

    text: in this seminar we learned all about the history and developments of
      typography, built a vocabulary to speak about letters, typefaces and text;
      the details, differences and classifications, about arranging letters to
      words and words to text; readability, emotion, communication. text as
      image, semiotics, vernacular typography and appropriation, the labour,
      ressources and ecology related to typography. We did this very hand-on,
      with an emphasis on critical discussions, extensive experimentation and
      funnnnn.
