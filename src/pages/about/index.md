Description: >-
  In my work as an academic assistant at the Karlsruhe University of Arts and
  Design, I give seminars in the Department of Communication Design on
  interdisciplinary topics such as the demystification of AI and virtual
  assistants, worldbuilding in video games, or the treatment of the
  Mediterranean region in the media as a border area. 


  I particularly like to use accessible formats, interactive installations, game formats, workshops, in combination with haptic experiences, special printing processes, working with ceramics and textiles. During the artist-in-residence program of PARADISE AIR in Matsudo, Japan, last year, I had the opportunity to work and exhibit. 


  I also have a freelance practice as a communication designer, where I created, for example, the new corporate design of the ABK Stuttgart, where I studied, or the exhibition design for Narrating Africa at the German Literature Archive in Marbach.\

  \

  I studied both communication design as well as fine arts at the Stuttgart State Academy of Arts and Design and at the Tokyo University of the Arts.
