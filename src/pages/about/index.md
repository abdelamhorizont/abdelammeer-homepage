      I specialize in bringing illustrative *ideas* to life through graphic
      design, using *drawing* as a relatable and *personal* tool for exploring
      compelling and tailored *aesthetics* that resonate with diverse audiences.
      Through colorful shapes and textures, I create objects, characters, and
      lettering that blend with *typography* and *layout* across various
      *formats*—like visual identities, books, spatial, interactive, and
      animated platforms. My portfolio includes works such as "Living Systems,"
      an illustrated and interactive simulation for the Kunstmuseum Stuttgart,
      the comprehensive corporate design of the ABK Stuttgart, or the exhibition
      design for Narrating Africa at the German Literature Archive in Marbach.


      My work is grounded in thorough *research* and personal *exchange* with all participants through *clear*, direct communication. I begin each project with *collaborative* workshops to establish a strong *conceptual* foundation. From concept to completion, I guide the entire *process*, drawing on my network of other creatives, coders, and printers when needed.


      Through workshops, artist residencies, and teaching, I explore my *interests*, such as *experiment* and speculation in drawing, AI embodiment and demystification, *accessibility* of illustration, and *empowerment* in video games. I document this research, *work-in-progress*, and results on my blog on this website.


      As an academic associate at the HfG Karlsruhe, I teach typography to first-year students, covering foundational skills in type design, history, vocabulary, and qualitative evaluation, as well as macro- and microtypography, information hierarchies, layout, and composition. The school's *interdisciplinary* environment has allowed me to lead seminars and workshops on AI demystification, Mediterranean Ocean media representation, video game platforms, and even a ping-pong tournament.


      I studied communication design at the Stuttgart State Academy of Arts and Design and at the Tokyo University of the Arts.
