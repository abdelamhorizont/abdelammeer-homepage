Description: >-
  Collections of intellectual texts about design and architecture in the shape
  of a publication series.

  I would go, deconstruct the literal content and order every letter alphabetically and use it as a design element as you can see on the cover. The envelope flap is perforated and can be used as a handy bookmark with the content on it.
