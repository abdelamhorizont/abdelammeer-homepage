  recap of our visuals and the great collective effort at the
  @new**normal**2022 


  together with @mikey.bajki @jamilla.vz @soennecken @jana.rzehak @tschaggi___ @andygrammel 


  As a group we were discussing the power of the images we could show, the possibilities to visually include a more diverse range of visitors and the fact that we couldn’t afford escapism looking at the current political landscape and ecological crisis but still wanting to create atmospheric moods with pretty visuals. Very much influenced by the horizontal space transformation in the concept of @duo_ufo @hplutsch , inspired by the roots and dawns in the graphics of @pumakuma @messermaxi and in symbiosis with the phenomenal musical line-up invited by @weiny__f and @marvin_unger – thank you for the opportunity! And thanks to everyone involved!


  With music by @smerz_ @socialcontainer @hhy_and_tku Will Guthrie, @alpha_maid @_m.sayyid , @levingoeslightly @freybenedikt @leifmueller @zweilaster @yung_0bama @jlowrose @pumakuma @djtheory @sirousalex, Mati, @michel_oder_michael Diana Müller mit Markus Götze, Menja Stevenson
