Description: In 2019, the current corporate design of ABK Stuttgart was
  introduced. The extensive design and implementation of the corporate identity
  was undertaken by Raphael Berg, Jasmina Begović and Abdelhamid Ameur,
  supervised by Prof. Uli Cluss, AM Stefanie Schwarz and the professors of the
  Communication Design program. The custom typeface ABK Stuttgart designed by
  Stefanie Schwarz and Dirk Wachowiak reflects upon more than 100 years of
  typographic tradition of the academy by taking up features and details of
  historical typefaces and reinterpreting them.
