Description: >-
  In 2019, the current corporate design of ABK Stuttgart was introduced. The
  extensive design and implementation of the corporate identity was undertaken
  by Raphael Berg, Jasmina Begović and Abdelhamid Ameur, supervised by Prof. Uli
  Cluss, AM Stefanie Schwarz and the professors of the Communication Design
  program. The custom typeface ABK Stuttgart designed by Stefanie Schwarz and
  Dirk Wachowiak reflects upon more than 100 years of typographic tradition of
  the academy by taking up features and details of historical typefaces and
  reinterpreting them.\

  The Design Manual explains design principles, technical details as well as guidelines and the handling of the elements, including logo, business card, letterhead, templates for Microsoft Word, Excel and PowerPoint, certificate, folder, stamp, as well as flags and janitorial clothing.
