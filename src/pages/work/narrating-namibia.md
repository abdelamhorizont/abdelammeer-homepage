Description: >-
  ‘Narrating Africa is an impossible task due to the cultural, linguistic
  diversity’ and at the same time an ‘interesting’ and ‘brave topic’, reflects
  Namibian writer Rémy Ngamije. The Deutsches Literaturarchiv Marbach – together
  with partners from universities and institutions in Germany, Switzerland and
  Namibia – takes on this challenge by asking questions such as ‘How do we
  narrate Africa as a continent and its diversity? Which images and stereo
  types, which colonial and national ideologies can we find in literature about
  Africa and how does literature shape, continue or do away with them in turn?’\

  \

  STEPTHREE focuses on literary texts and cultural objects that narrate Namibia. The selection of texts portrays the multilingual Namibian society. Together, texts and objects represent snapshots of Namibian literature and culture. Scholars and writers discuss and contextualise their meaning and narration, but also raise further questions. Come and see for yourself.
