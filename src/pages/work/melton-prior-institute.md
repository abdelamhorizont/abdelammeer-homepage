  Digital archive and redesign for the melton prior institute with an extensive
  platform for research and publishing.


  The Melton Prior Institute is located in DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany, and provides the basis for an internationally oriented research on the histories of press graphics, illustration, reportage drawing, and related techniques of printing. It presently consists of a collection of original drawings, prints and portfolios by relevant artists, as well as of a library stressing the documentation of graphic reporting in the early stages of pictorial press publishing from the 19th century. The institute publishes new contributions on its website in irregular intervals.
