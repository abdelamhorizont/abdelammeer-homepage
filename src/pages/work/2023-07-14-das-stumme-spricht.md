Over a period of two years (2019-2022), we investigated the major construction site »Stuttgart 21« in an artistic-experimental way. The construction site was reinterpreted as an archaeological site. In the context of this work, we take on the role of excavators by photographically documenting the construction site, collecting finds,3D scanning them, archiving them, and examining them for their aesthetic and functional characteristics. In a kind of modern palimpsesting process, the finds were further processed, thus giving them a new value.
