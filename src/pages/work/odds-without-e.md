Description: >-
  For most, digital networking has become a lifeline during the period of
  curfews. In addition, many have decluttered their homes and offered discarded
  items to their neighbors via eBay Kleinanzeigen, so as not to lose contact
  with the outside world. The exhibition Odds Without Ends uses eBay
  Kleinanzeigen, the largest digital platform for classified ads in Germany, as
  an exhibition space for site-specific works.


  Odds Without Ends uses eBay Kleinanzeigen as an exhibition space and brings art directly to bargain hunters' homes. The works on display use the ad space as their medium and the vented space as their public. Each work is live for a limited time only, during which it may be discovered by accident or on purpose. The works unfold over a maximum of 60 days - the maximum lifespan of ads on eBay Kleinanzeigen â€” following their own logic of exchange and participation. The exhibition Odds Without Ends features works developed specifically for eBay Kleinanzeigen by students in the Brenner/Bitnik class. It was organized by the !Mediengruppe Bitnik.
