  Over a period of two years (2019-2022), we investigated the major construction
  site »Stuttgart 21« in an artistic-experimental way. The construction site was
  reinterpreted as an archaeological site. In the context of this work, we take
  on the role of excavators by photographically documenting the construction
  site, collecting finds,3D scanning them, archiving them, and examining them
  for their aesthetic and functional characteristics. In a kind of modern
  palimpsesting process, the finds were further processed, thus giving them a
  new value.

Over a period of two years (2019-2022), we investigated the major construction site »Stuttgart 21« in an artistic-experimental way. The construction site was reinterpreted as an archaeological site. In the context of this work, we take on the role of excavators by photographically documenting the construction site, collecting finds,3D scanning them, archiving them, and examining them for their aesthetic and functional characteristics. In a kind of modern palimpsesting process, the finds were further processed, thus giving them a new value.

The various contributions to the project offer the possibility of an interactive debate and create reference between layering, reinterpretation and superimposition. They celebrate the unfinished, the transformation process and highlight the spatial and aesthetic qualities of urban space. At the same time, the work can be understood as a documentation for the future. When the process of construction is completely displaced and no longer perceptible. The digital archive [www.cite-mine.online](www.cite-mine.online), the video work „Momentaufnahmen“, the spatial installation [Erdraum](www.cite-mine.online) and a publication are results of this research work.

The earth room invites visitors to „go underground“ and serves as a platform for the various contributions to the project Archaeology of a city mine, which in different ways allow the processes of the construction site to be viewed in a new context.
