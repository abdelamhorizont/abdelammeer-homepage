Description: >-
  "How do we tell stories about Africa: about a continent and its diversity?
  Which images and stereotypes, which colonial and national ideologies determine
  literature about Africa and are shaped, disseminated or dismantled by it? In
  an open space exhibition, we discuss this with texts, archival finds, lecture
  performances, and conversations with partners from Namibia and writers from
  Africa and Europe, among others."\

  in collaboration with the Literaturmuseum der Moderne Marbach we designed the exhibition "Narrating Africa", for which we developed a system to transfer content from different curators into one exhibition space. The design concept offers the possibility to add content to the exhibition step by step over a longer period of time and to link it with each other by commenting on it. The table tops are covered with magnetic ferrofoil printed image motifs and quotations and are supplemented by expandable cards and leporellos, which, equipped with magnets, adhere to the table but can also be held in the hands. The visitor is invited to settle down on seat cushions, to open and discover the various contents and to surrender to an unusual sense of space. The visual language can be found on accompanying media such as posters, postcards, the program or the website.
