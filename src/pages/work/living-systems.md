Description: >-
  Living Systems, a simultion based on Conwayâ€˜s Game of Life for Kunstmuseum
  Stuttgart 


  The interactive simulation showcasing the rise, fall and changes in a society of living organisms is based on a few simple rules that lead to stable, instable and the emergence of various semistable patterns: still lives, oscillators and spaceships, which themselves can be used to simulate for example the simulation itself ðŸ¤¯


  1. every system with zero or one neighbor disappears, as in an underpopulation.

  2. every system with two or three neighbors lives on in the next generation.

  3. every system with more than three neighbors disappears, as in the case of overpopulation.

  4. a new system is created with exactly three neighbors, as in reproduction.


  feedback from Laura WÃ¼nsche and Stefan Stegmaier.

  Technical installation and code support by Stefan Avramescu  


  Currently on display in Studio 11 at the Kunstmuseum Stuttgart
